testify has 2 main features for us, assert and mock

## assert
The assert package provides some helpful methods that allow you to write better test code in Go.

- Prints friendly, easy to read failure descriptions
- Allows for very readable code
- Optionally annotate each assertion with a message

example:

```go
package some_package_test

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(t, 123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(t, 123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(t, object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(t, object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal(t, "Something", object.Value)

  }

}
```

- Every assert func takes the testing.T object as the first argument. This is how it writes the errors out through the normal go test capabilities.
- Every assert func returns a bool indicating whether the assertion was successful or not, this is useful for if you want to go on making further assertions under certain conditions.

if you assert many times, use the below:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
  assert := assert.New(t)

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal("Something", object.Value)
  }
}
```

## require

## mock

The `mock` package provides a mechanism for easily writing mock objects that can be used in place of real objects when writing test code.

An example test function that tests a piece of code that relies on an external object `testObj`, can set up expectations (testify) and assert that they indeed happened:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
)

/*
  Test objects
*/

// MyMockedObject is a mocked object that implements an interface
// that describes an object that the code I am testing relies on.
type MyMockedObject struct{
  mock.Mock
}

// DoSomething is a method on MyMockedObject that implements some interface
// and just records the activity, and returns what the Mock object tells it to.
//
// In the real object, this method would do something useful, but since this
// is a mocked object - we're just going to stub it out.
//
// NOTE: This method is not being tested here, code that uses this object is.
func (m *MyMockedObject) DoSomething(number int) (bool, error) {

  args := m.Called(number)
  return args.Bool(0), args.Error(1)

}

/*
  Actual test functions
*/

// TestSomething is an example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // create an instance of our test object
  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

  // set up expectations
  testObj.On("DoSomething", 123).Return(true, nil)

  // call the code we are testing
  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

  // assert that the expectations were met
  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)


}

// TestSomethingWithPlaceholder is a second example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
// This time using a placeholder. Placeholders might be used when the
// data being passed in is normally dynamically generated and cannot be
// predicted beforehand (eg. containing hashes that are time sensitive)
func TestSomethingWithPlaceholder(t *testing.T) {

  // create an instance of our test object
  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

  // set up expectations with a placeholder in the argument list
  testObj.On("DoSomething", mock.Anything).Return(true, nil)

  // call the code we are testing
  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

  // assert that the expectations were met
  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)


}

// TestSomethingElse2 is a third example that shows how you can use
// the Unset method to cleanup handlers and then add new ones.
func TestSomethingElse2(t *testing.T) {

  // create an instance of our test object
  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

  // set up expectations with a placeholder in the argument list
  mockCall := testObj.On("DoSomething", mock.Anything).Return(true, nil)

  // call the code we are testing
  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

  // assert that the expectations were met
  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)

  // remove the handler now so we can add another one that takes precedence
  mockCall.Unset()

  // return false now instead of true
  testObj.On("DoSomething", mock.Anything).Return(false, nil)

  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)
}
```
